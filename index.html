     Accessability

    <p>
      When building a website remember to keep Web Content Accessibility Guidlines (WCAGs) in mind. The principles of the WCAG are: Perceptability, Operability, Understandability, and Rubustness. When in doubt consult Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidlines (ATAG) and User Agent Accessibility Guidlines (UAAG). More information is availabe at w3.org/wai.

      Acronyms: HTML, HTTP, and URL
    </h2>
    <p>
      To begin, there are three acronyms to recognize: HTML, HTTP, and URL. HTML is "Hypertext Markup Language." HTTP is "Hypertext Transfer Protocol." URL is "Uniform Resource Locator."

        Historical Note
      </h3>
    <p>
      In 1989 it was Tim Berners-Lee who created HTML as a uniform way to incorporate hyperlinks into code, particularly by building on Standard Generalized Makrup Language (SGML). SGML is why HTML uses brackets ("<" and ">").

      Visit archive.org to check out the, you guessed it, archived versions of a variety of websites. Check out the ones that currently have internet monopolies! Just goes to show that, with a little hard work, you too can become an oligarch.
